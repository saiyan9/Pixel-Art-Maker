This project was a great way to practice the HTML, CSS and JavaScript tools I learned during my Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree program.

The CSS and JavaScript files are linked to the HTML file.

When the user launches the HTML file, they will be able to select the canvas size they would like to use (there is a limit on how big the canvas is created - just so we don't crash!). Once the canvas is generated, the user may use the color picker to select which color(s) they would like to use to create their own work of art.
