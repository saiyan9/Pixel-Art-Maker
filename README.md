# Pixel Art Maker #

## Description
This a project that consists of a webpage that allows users to create pixel art in any color they want, on a canvas size that they choose.

## Languages
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Structure
* designs.js
* index.html   
* styles.css 
*  README.md

## Usage
When the user launches the HTML file, they will be able to select the canvas size they would like to use (there is a limit on how big the canvas is created - just so we don't crash!). Once the canvas is generated, the user may use the color picker to select which color(s) they would like to use to create their own work of art. 

## Acknowledgements
I received extra guidance and understanding of HTML and CSS from W3Schools.com.
